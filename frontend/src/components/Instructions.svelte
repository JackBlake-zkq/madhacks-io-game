        Hold down mouse 1 or spacebar to spin and gain speed.
        You will lose speed while not spinning.
        If you collide with another player, the person with the lower speed will die and the person with the higher speed will gain speed.
        If a player who is not spinning collides with you while you are spinning, you will die.
        If two spinning players collide, the one with the higher speed will win and the one with the lower speed will die.
        Colliding with borders will cause you to stop spinning and lose speed.
        Increase your speed to dominate the server.
